# Proposal 2: Creation of The BioFont Font Family

The codepoints newly mapped to chemical entities, need defined glyphs to allow
visual representations of the bio-sequences.

Fonts need to be designed systematically as to allow biologists to learn the
system and then be able to read the glyphs, i.e. deduce the structure they
represent.


The following fonts are proposed:

### Font BioNorm

Glyphs with a focus on the entire chemical entity.

e.g. a glyph representing am Asparagine with it's modification for a
N-gycolysated asparagine


### Font BioMod

Glyphs with a focus on the modification.

e.g. Display a representation of the specific glycan (e.g. tree structure) for
a N-gycolysated asparagine


### Font BioCore

Glyphs with a focus on the modified entity.

Might display something close to what an unmodified entity would be represented.

e.g. Display a visually modified N (e.g. with a doted bakground) for a N-gycolysated asparagine

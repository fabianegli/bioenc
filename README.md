# Bio-sequence Alphabet Expansion

This repository is ground zero for my project to expand the bio-sequence
alphabet to allow a wider range of chemical entities as part of bio-sequences,
i.e. post-translational modifications of proteins and DNA modifications.

The general idea is summarized in the following graphic.

# Community Input

This is a great endeavor and requires input from many stakeholders. These
include all people who generate, store and work with bio-sequence information.

The input/feedback/proposals from anyone involved with bio-sequence data will be
considered. There are multiple ways to get your voice heard:

* *Become a Collaborator*: Become a part of the team shaping the future of
bio-sequence encoding. Write me an [email][1].
* Open an Issue in this repository.

# Why I chose this Restrictive License

I need money to life - and this is my project. Don't steal it. Once I get the
funding, I will release this repository and its contents under a permissive
license to benefit the scientific community. After all, this is the whole idea
of this project.


# Why I made it visible to the public

Too many ideas of researchers trying to get funding for their projects,
including preliminary data, are kept in secret, are not funded, and when no
funding is given everything is forgotten and finally lost. I don't want this to
happen with this idea and prevent the time and effort put into this to be lost.

I hope to achieve the following by publicizing the project development:

* Facilitate the participation and collaboration of people in the field.
* Preventing multiple funding agencies from funding the same work.
* Speeding up the project - and science.
* Letting the world know this is my idea.
    > Research is necessarily collaborative and the project needs to be shared
    anyway with a large amount of people. So I figured, once the idea is shared
    it can be shared in this way, too.

This is the first time I try to get funding for a scientific project of mine.
I will also collect data and information about the funding process and try to
make it a resource for other scientist searching for funding of similar
projects.

I also hope that funding bodies see this as a proof of my dedication to
transparency and open access to scientific research carried out at public
institutions.

# Biosequence Alphabet Expansion

This repository is the ground zero for my project to expand the biosequence
alphabet to allow a wider range of chemical entities as part of biosequences,
i.e. post-translational modifications of proteins and DNA modifications.


# Financial Support

I need money to buy the coffee required for this project. Please contact me if
you have money or know where to get it from.


# Community Input

This is a great endeavor and requires input from many stakeholders. These
include all people who generate, store and work with biosequence information.

The input/feedback/proposals from anyone involved with biosequence data will be
considered. There are multiple ways to get your voice heard:

* *Become a Collaborator*: Become a part of the team shaping the future of biosequence
encoding. Write me an [email][1].
* Open an Issue in this repository.

### Why this Restrictive License

I need money to life - and this is my project. Don't steal it. Once I get the
funding, I will release this repository and its contents under a permissive
license to benefit the scientific community. After all, this is the whole idea
of this project.

# Why UTF-8/Unicode

From the [Unicode FAQ](http://www.unicode.org/faq/basic_q.html):

> Q: What is the scope of Unicode?
>
> A: Unicode covers all the characters for all the writing systems of the world, modern and ancient. It also includes technical symbols, punctuations, and many other characters used in writing text. The Unicode Standard is intended to support the needs of all types of users, whether in business or academia, using mainstream or minority scripts.

This is a clear commitment to science and as biosequences are central to biology
and life itself, I believe that "The Unicode Consortium" can be convinced to
dedicate a fair number of codepoints to nucleic and amino acids.
